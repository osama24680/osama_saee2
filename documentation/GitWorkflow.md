## STARTING FROM DEV BRANCH

================================

### story, bug, and task (some times) branches are created

================================

### The dev branch is the development branch in which all the code from other branches is integrated into it

### We also do not work directly in the dev branch

### Each task branch is made of its own, pulled from the dev, and after it is worked on, it is merged into the dev

### Each branch for each task is named with the name and number of the task

### Our work is divided into two parts, Story and Task. The story describes a complete process or cycle for a specific feature, and the work is divided into several tasks according to their size.
